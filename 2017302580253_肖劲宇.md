## P4
a.01011100 + 01100101 = 11000001,the complement is 00111110.  
b.11011010 + 01100101 =  1 00111111,Result has carry bit so the first bit needs wraparound : 01000000, the complement is 10111111.  
c.Both bytes' last bit flipped,First byte = 01011100; second byte = 01100101. the answer is also 00111110.   

## P22
There are two condition in the following graph:  
![P22](https://github.com/xjywhu/WLFBSHomeWork5/blob/master/P22.png)   
a. 
In the first condition, all packets in the window before the serial number k have not been ACked. At this time, the serial number range in the window is:[k-N,k-1].  
In the second condition, all packets before the serial number k have been ACked. At this time, the serial number range in the window is:[k,k+N-1].  
The range of window base number is [k-N,k]. The sequence number in the window may be [k-N,k+N-1].
b.
In the first condition, the ACK number is k-N,which is the min value of ack number.  
In the second condition, the ACK number is k-1,which is the max value of ack number.  
so the range of ACK number is (k-N-1,k-1]
